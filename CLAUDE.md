# Clanfire — notes for Claude

Vanilla JS + Canvas 2D, classic scripts sharing globals (`CFG`/`T`, `S`/`G`, `UI`,
`Bld`, `Units`, `R`, …). No build step. Deploy = commit on the working branch,
fast-forward merge to `main`, push both; GitHub Pages serves `main`.

## Tap & selection contract — DO NOT re-break

Tap accuracy has regressed multiple times when nearby code changed. It is now
covered by a contract test. **Run it after touching any of:**

- `ui.js` — `handleTap`, `handleDoubleTap`, `snapNear`, `select`/`deselect`, unit hit-testing
- `units.js` — `assignGather`, `assignBuild`, `moveTo`, `setPath`
- `render.js` — `screenToWorld`, `screenToTile`, unit drawing offsets
- `config.js` — `TILE`, `SPRITE_LIFT`, `GATHER`

```
node tests/tap-audit.mjs      # exits non-zero on any regression
```

The invariants it enforces (details in the test file):

1. **Hit-tests aim at the drawn sprite, not the logical position.** Unit sprites
   render `CFG.SPRITE_LIFT` px above `u.y` — that constant is the single source
   of truth for BOTH render.js and the hit-tests in ui.js. Never hard-code the
   lift anywhere else.
2. **While a unit/party is selected, taps are orders first.** A bystander own
   unit only steals the selection when tapped dead-on (≤0.55 tiles from its
   visual center; tighter still on resource tiles). Transports stay boardable.
3. **Near-miss snapping** (`UI.snapNear`, ~0.4 tile forgiveness): slightly-off
   taps land on the intended resource / camp / build site / enemy building —
   but each snap is gated by what the current selection could actually DO
   there, so e.g. a walk order beside a healthy wall is never stolen.
4. **No silent failures.** An order that can't be carried out (e.g. no clear
   ground beside a resource) must toast a reason.
5. A stationed worker (or builder) wins taps on their own plot; the building
   takes the tap once nobody works it. Dead-on taps always reselect.

If a new feature genuinely needs different tap behaviour, update
`tests/tap-audit.mjs` in the same commit and say so in the commit message —
never leave the test failing or weaken a threshold without explaining why.
